Bipartite graphs & matchings
1. defs and examples
2. alternating paths and augmentations -- why is this valuable, figures, thm M maximum iff no 
alternating paths
3. template for maximum matchings (alternating forests) -- vague pseudocode for matching algorithm: 
alternating path, augment until no more alternating paths

Vertex covers (bipartite)
1. definitions and examples
2. Konig-Egervary theorem relating maximum matchings to vertex cover

(Integer) linear programming
1. general formulation & terminology
2. examples: maximal matching, vertex cover: make sure to relate the linear programs to these 
2.5: weighted matchings?
3. primal/dual theory

Hungarian algorithm 
1. unweighted 
2. weighted
